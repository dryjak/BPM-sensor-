# BPM-sensor-

This repository contains a simple Arduino project that I used to learn I2C communication. The project utilizes a 128x64 I2C OLED display and the GY-MAX30102 sensor to measure heart rate (BPM) and learn about basic sensor usage.

## Introduction
This project is designed to help beginners understand the basics of I2C communication and sensor integration using Arduino. It reads heart rate data from the GY-MAX30102 sensor and displays the readings on an OLED screen.

## Components
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 128x64 I2C OLED display
- GY-MAX30102 heart rate sensor
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard
